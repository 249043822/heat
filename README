This is the beginings of a AWS Cloudformation API written
in the style of an openstack project.


Why heat? It makes the clouds raise and keeps them there.

try:
./bin/heat-api

and in another shell
./bin/heat create my_stack --template-file=./templates/getting_started.template  --parameters "param1=foo;param2=bar"
