"""Handles all processes relating to instances (guest vms).

The :py:class:`ComputeManager` class is a :py:class:`heat.manager.Manager` that
handles RPC calls relating to creating instances.  It is responsible for
building a disk image, launching it via the underlying virtualization driver,
responding to calls to check its state, attaching persistent storage, and
terminating it.

:instances_path:  Where instances are kept on disk
:compute_driver:  Name of class that is used to handle virtualization, loaded
                  by :func:`heat.utils.import_object`
