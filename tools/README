+ experimental_create.py
     - Example of creating an keypair and instantiating an instance after
        one has been registered with JEOS create

+ openstack - WARNING COULD DESTROY DATA
    - Installs, Uninstalls, starts, and stops openstack from the RPM repository
      on F16 or F17.  This provides a consistent way for developers to deploy
      openstack in a consistent painless way.

      THIS IS NOT INTENDED FOR END USERS AS IT COULD PERMANENTLY DESTROY DATA
      AND DOES NOT PROPERLY SECURE THE INSTALLATION.

+ experimental_ssh_eventlet.py
     - Example of using ssh inside python with eventlets.
